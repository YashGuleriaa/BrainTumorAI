**Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning**
Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model can classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Features

Deep Learning-Based Classification: Uses CNNs for high-accuracy tumor detection.

Preprocessed Dataset: Utilizes preprocessed MRI scans to improve model efficiency.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trains on labeled MRI images and evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface to upload MRI scans and get predictions.

Visualization: Displays heatmaps to highlight tumor regions in the MRI scan.

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled MRI scan images of brain tumors. It includes:

Tumor MRI Scans

Non-Tumor MRI Scans

You can find public datasets from sources like Kaggle or medical research institutions.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
